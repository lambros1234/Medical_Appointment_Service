## 🗄️ Database Setup
This project uses PostgreSQL

If you already have PostgreSQL running: 
- Update application.properties in the backend with your database credentials
If not:
- Uncomment the **DB** service in **docker-compose.yml**
Example
```yaml
db:
  image: postgres:15
  container_name: db
  environment:
    POSTGRES_DB: medical_appointments
    POSTGRES_USER: postgres
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
  ports:
    - "5432:5432"
  volumes:
    - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```
Then restart:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## 🔑 Default Credentials (Testing)
You can register new users via the frontend

Default admin account:
```code
Username: admin1
Password: admin123
```
Available Roles:
- ROLE_ADMIN
- ROLE_DOCTOR
- ROLE_PATIENT
