---

## Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chalatsis2004/Medical_Appointment_Service
cd Medical_Appointment_Service
```
Build and start the service:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
This will start:
- Backend: http://localhost:8080
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- MailHog: (fake SMTP for dev): http://localhost:8025
- PostgreSQL: http://localhost:5432 (if enabled)

## Databse Setup
This project requires a PostgreSQL database.
- If you already have Postgres running, update the backendâ€™s application.properties with your DB connection.
- If not, you can use the provided Docker Compose service.

In docker-compose.yml, the db service is commented out by default.
To use it:
- Uncomment the db service section.
- Update the backend service environment variables if needed (or keep defaults).

Example db service:
```
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: medical_appointments
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```
Then restart with: 
```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Credentials
When the application starts, you can sign up via the frontend.
Default roles available:
- ROLE_ADMIN
- ROLE_PATIENT
- ROLE_DOCTOR

Default user (for testing):
- Username: admin1
- Password: admin123
